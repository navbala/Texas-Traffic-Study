# Project Description/Outline
    A Flask-powered web page to determine if there are patterns between speed-related traffic stops/incidents and demographic identifiers in Texas from 2010 to 2016.

# Research Questions to Answer
    What trends are visible in traffic stops by demographic identifiers (Race/Age/Gender)?
    What trends are visible in traffic accidents by demographic identifiers (Race/Age/Gender)?
    Is there a correlation between the demographic identifiers of the individuals involved and the number of traffic stops?
    Which areas have the highest concentrations of traffic accidents and has there been any trends of which areas are more prone to accidents?
