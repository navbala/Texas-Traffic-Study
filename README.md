    What trends are visible in traffic accidents by demographic identifiers (Race/Age/Gender)?
    Is there a correlation between the demographic identifiers of the individuals involved and the number of traffic stops?
    Which areas have the highest concentrations of traffic accidents and has there been any trends of which areas are more prone to accidents?
